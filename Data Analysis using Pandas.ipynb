This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZfelutoyTS25"},"source":["**How to perform Exploratory Data Analysis ?**\n","\n","This is one such question that everyone is keen on knowing the answer.
